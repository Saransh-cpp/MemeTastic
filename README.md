# MemeTastic

Frontend for Elasticsearch X Code for Cause Hackathon.

## How it works

- The app pull latest memes from my `elasticsearch` server hosted on cloud and displays them.

- It also utilises the search capabilities using `ngrams` to search for any meme.
 
- You can also share the memes;).
