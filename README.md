# MemeTastic

Summon and search Reddit memes anywhere and anytime!

Frontend for Elasticsearch X Code for Cause Hackathon. (Winner for the hackthon - [devpost project](https://devpost.com/software/memetastic))

## How it works

- Backend working on `GitHub Actions` [here](https://github.com/Saransh-cpp/MemeTastic-backend) which is actually responsible for ingesting data into `elasticsearch`.

- The app pulls latest memes from my `elasticsearch` server hosted on cloud and displays them.

- It also utilises the search capabilities using `ngrams` analyzer to search for any meme.
 
- You can also share the memes;).
